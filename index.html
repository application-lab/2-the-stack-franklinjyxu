        <h1>Applying Stack Theory in Analyzing Negative Impacts of a Digital Life</h1>
        <p class="grey">In last assigment I identified that social media platforms in China (along with Western ones) were exploited by state-backed efforts to distort facts and serve propoganda agendas amid Hong Kong protests over the controversial extradition bill. Moreover, such efforts essentially deepen the misunderstandings between Hong Kong citizens and Mainlanders and limit each sides to their own rhetorics.</p>

                </ul>

            <p><strong>USER</strong></p>
                <img src="https://i.ibb.co/GJg2K6Y/Wechat-IMG129.jpg" width="400" height="800"/>
                <p>Users can be state media, or state-media backed Fangirls who align patriotism with admiration for a ficticious new idol, or ordinary citizens buying into the propoganda and expressing extreme patriotism or bot armies implemented by any previously mentioned entities. (The picture above shows a Fangirl account cursing Hong Kong protesters and advocating for a state-promoted ficticious handsome idol.)
                </p>
            <p><strong>INTERFACE</strong>
            </p>
                <img src="https://i.ibb.co/3dpJk2Q/Wechat-IMG130.jpg" width="400" height="800">
                <p>Interface in this case can refer to all those social media accounts created by various propaganda entities along with the articles or media they posted on their social media accounts. It can be on Wechat moments, Wechat official accounts, Weibo posts (including trending keywords and hashtags), and posts/comments on Twitter and Instagram. The picture above is a hatred-driven account cursing protestors to their death with post images equalizing protestors to ISIS terrorists.
                </p>
            <p><strong>ADDRESS</strong>
            </p>

                <p>Address can be IP addresses of all those propagandists and some utilize VPNs to get over the Great Fire Wall and spread such hate contents on western social medias, crossing the boundaries between two different Internet sovereignties. It's quite ironic that Chinese state at one hand deems such behavior (moving to another address) as illegal but on the other hand promotes such behavior in favor of its own political agenda.
                </p>
            <p><strong>CITY</strong>
            </p>
                <img src="https://i.ibb.co/HTthRQT/policeee.jpg" width="300" height="220">
                <p>City in this context is all about connection of nodes; it might simply be Internet providers (all the telecom companies) and it can also be the form of governance connecting physical addresses with IP addresses such as cyber surveillance. In China, cyber police monitors and filters out contents and some vocal online pro-democracy activists were frequently detained by police.
                </p>
            <p><strong>CLOUD</strong>
            </p>
                <img src="https://i.ibb.co/0CHFGWd/Screenshot-2019-09-15-22-59-50.png" width="400" height="300"/>
                <p>Cloud hightlights the notion of "placeness" as a new storage hub for data. Chinese state is certainly integrating itself into the cloud. In this case, Chinese social media companies all have their own servers and cloud computing units, so do Facebook. The segmentation and new notion of social media sovereignty represent 2 different logics of geopolitcs.
                </p>
            <p><strong>EARTH</strong>
            </p>
                <img src="https://i.ibb.co/TBWMptJ/Screenshot-2019-09-15-23-06-36.png" width="300" height="400"/>
                <p>Earth refers to the physicality of the real data processing, usually held in a data center. All social media companies have data center near an energy producer. The picture above is FB's data center from inside and outside.
